# Language Models

Language Models quantify our assumptions on what should be the next word given a sequence by probability. LMs can also assign the probability to sentences. This helps in choosing which of the two sentences are more probable in occuring in the corpus.

N-Grams are sequence of n-words. Bi-grams, Tri-grams, etc.

One way to predict the probability of next word is in the following way,

$$
P(w/h) = P(w âˆ© h)/ P(h)
$$
