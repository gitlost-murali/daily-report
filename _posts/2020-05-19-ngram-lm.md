# Language Models

Briefly, Language Models, are `models` that assign probability to each possible next word given a sequence. LMs can also assign the probability to sentences. This helps in choosing which of the two sentences are more probable in occuring in the corpus.

LMs are used in grammar correction and speech recognition systems to select the appropriate phrase or sequence. Statistical LMs make use of N-grams for obtaining probabilities.

## N-Grams

N-Grams are sequence of n-words. Bi-grams, Tri-grams, etc.

One way to predict the probability of next word is in the following way,

$$
P(w/h) = P(w âˆ© h)/ P(h)
$$
