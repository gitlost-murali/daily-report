# Edit Distance

## String Similarity

Much of NLP use-cases spectrum require similarity b/w two strings. This can be considered at two levels,

1. Character level (Spelling Correction): User entered word `graffe` would probably mean `giraffe` rather than `grail` or `coffee` by assuming that `giraffe` is just a character away.
2. Word Level (Coreference Resolution): Strings `Hollywood director James` and `Hollywood movie director James` refer to the same entity. The fact that these differ only by a single word can be used as evidence to decide if these strings are coherent or not.

## Edit Distance

__Edit Distance__ provides a way to quantify the assumptions on string similarities. Specifically, minimum edit distance is the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string to another. Edit distance is inversely proportional to the similarity of strings.

__Cost of operations__: To transform one word to another, three operations are used. Namely, `insert, delete, substitute`. We can assign different costs to each operation. Levenstein, in his alternate version, suggested removing `substitute` operation, thereby meaning `substitute = delete + insert`. If insert, delete have a cost 1, substitute would have a cost 2 for execution.

__Solution Space__: Solution space to transform one word to another is huge. Moreover, it is possible that two paths might have the same outcome despite diff paths. We don't want to exhaust our compute power iterating over all possibilities. Therefore, Dynamic programming is used to find optimal path and edit distance.

## Computing Minimum Edit Distance

Dynamic programming is a tabled-based method used to solve large problems by combining solutions of sub-problems. The intituition is that a large problem can be solved by properly combining the solutions to various sub-problems.

### Using DP for Edit Distance

Given a source string `X` of length `n` and target `Y` of length m, when we say various sub-problems, we mean all possible conversions i.e Transforming all source sub-strings $X[0..i]$ (where $0<=i<=n$) to target sub-strings $Y[0..j]$ ( where $0<=j<=m$). D[i,j] is the edit distance b/w $X[0..i]$ & $Y[0..j]$. Minimum edit distance for X,Y is D[n,m].

Let's consider the following case,

X = "intention"
Y = "execution"

For sub-problems like $D[i,0]$, cost involved is `i` as there are `i` delete operations involved to reach the target string `""` (null). Similarly, for $D[0,j]$, cost involved is `j` since it'd require `j` insert operations to transform an empty string into the one with `j` characters.

If the above made statement didn't make sense, try it out with few samples,

__Sub-Problem__| __Src -> Tgt__ | __Operations involved__
D[0,0] | "" -> ""  |  0
D[0,1] | "" -> "e" | 1 insert operation
D[0,2] | "" -> "ex" | 2 insert operations
       |            |
D[0,j] |            | __j__ insert operations
D[1,0] | "i" -> ""  | 1 delete operation
D[2,0] | "in" -> "" | 2 delete operations
...    |      ...   |
D[i,0] |            | __i__ delete operations

Next, let's scale up to other sub-problems

For, `D[1,1]`, i.e, `"i"` (src) $=>$ `"e"` (tgt), the operations would be `delete i & insert e`. It can also be considered in terms of 3 possible paths i.e through 3 sub-problems,

1. Through D[0,1], i.e, `""` $=>$ `"e"`, where we can add a insert operation `"i"` to `src` side and we will arrive at D[1,1].
2. Through D[1,0], i.e, `"i"` $=>$ `""`, where we can add a insert operation `"e"` to `tgt` side and we will arrive at D[1,1].
3. Through D[0,0], i.e, `""` $=>$ `""`, where we add a insert & delete operation `"i"` to `src` and `"e"` to `tgt` side and we will arrive at D[1,1].

When you repeat this several times,  a common pattern emerges:

$$D[i,j] = min(D[i-1, j]+1, D[i, j-1]+1, D[i-1, j-1]+ $$ (2 if source[i]!=target[j] else 0))


Using the above logic, we can get the Minimum Edit Distance for Source & Target.

### Alignments

Minimum Edit Distance alone is not much useful. Alignments i.e which character in source word corresponds to which char in target words, are useful in applications like Machine Translation, Speech Translation, etc.

We can get the alignments by simply storing which neighboring sub-problem (refer to the logic above) had the minimum cost for each sub-problem.
